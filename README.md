# Jekyll::Babel

A Babel converter for Jekyll.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/babel/jekyll-babel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/babel/jekyll-babel)

> Based on [jekyll-coffeescript](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-coffeescript) by @parkr.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jekyll-babel'
```

Then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

You may also skip using a Gemfile and install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll-babel
```

Finally, in you Jekyll's \_config.yml file, add:

```yml
gems:
  - jekyll-babel
```

**Notes: `jekyll-babel` requires Ruby 1.9.3 or greater. Additionally, the dependency on `execjs` means you must also have a [valid JavaScript runtime](https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs#execjs) available to your project**

## Usage

In your Jekyll site, create Babel-aware files that start with the following
lines:

```
---
---
```

You need those three dashes in order for Jekyll to recognize it as
"convertible". They won't be included in the content passed to the Babel
compiler.

## Options

Files with extensions .js, .es6, .babel and .jsx will be processed. You may
customize the list of white-listed extensions in your _config.yml, by providing
a string of comma-separated values:

```yml
babel_js_extensions: 'es6, babel, jsx' # Do not process .js files
```

You can also pass custom [babel options](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/options) by
adding the following to your _config.yml:

```yml
babel_js_options:
  comments: false
  compact: true
```
